This currency-checker app this is a basic currency checker app I created in Swift for iOS.  The api used was 'https://fixer.io' and all prices are against the 'Euro'.  You will need your own api key to run this app and will also need to add the following value in the info.plist 
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
	<dict>
		<key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
		<true/>
	</dict>
  
  To allow the app to connect
